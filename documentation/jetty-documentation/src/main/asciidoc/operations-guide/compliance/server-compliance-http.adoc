=== HTTP Compliance Modes
When Jetty was first implemented in 1995, there was a W3C specification for https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html[HTTP/0.9], which since has been obsoleted or augmented by:

 * https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1945[RFC 1945] for HTTP/1.0 in 1996
 * https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2068[RFC 2068] for HTTP/1.1  in 1997
 * https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616[RFC 2616] for HTTP/1.1 bis in 1999
 * https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230[RFC 7230], https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231[RFC 7231], https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7232[RFC 7232], https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7233[RFC 7233], https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7234[RFC 7234], https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7235[RFC 7235] again for HTTP/1.1 in 2014
 * https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7540[RFC 7540] for HTTP/2.0 in 2015

In addition to these evolving requirements, some earlier version of Jetty did not completely implement the RFC at the time (e.g. case insentive method names).   The https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/javadoc/jetty-10/org/eclipse/jetty/http/HttpCompliance.Violation.html[HttpCompliance.Violation] enumeration contains the RFC violations that can be allowed to support legacy operation of Jetty.

The https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/javadoc/jetty-10/org/eclipse/jetty/http/HttpCompliance.html[HttpCompliance] class defines several named https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/javadoc/jetty-10/org/eclipse/jetty/http/ComplianceViolation.Mode.html[Mode]s that
support common deployed sets of violations.
